Here we adapt Twelfth Night to modern (2012, 2013) American communication
methods like Facebook.

I called our script an "outline" because we don't intend for it to be as
precise as the word "script" might imply.

## Characters
The edition from Project Gutenberg tells us of these characters.

    ORSINO, Duke of Illyria.
    SEBASTIAN, a young Gentleman, brother to Viola.
    ANTONIO, a Sea Captain, friend to Sebastian.

## Code snippets
This finds characters in `gutenberg.txt`.

    grep -e '^[A-Z]*\.' gutenberg.txt | grep -v 'P. O. Box' | cut -d. -f1 | sort -u

This converts the list of scenes and characters from
[playshakespeare](http://www.playshakespeare.com/twelfth-night/scenes) to
something simple.

    sed -n \
      -e 's/<h3 class="scenetitle">/\n### /p' \
      -e 's/<p class="scenelocation">/\n**Location**: /p' \
      -e 's/<p class="scenepersonae">/\n**Characters**: /p' \
      Twelfth Night Scenes.html | cut -d\< -f1 |
      sed 's/### Scene 1/## Act\n\n### Scene 1/' >
      outline.md
